This is a challenge to test your problem solving skills and familiarity with the React ecosystem. Setup the project on your machine under a new branch, then follow the instructions below. When you're done, push all of your changes up (ideally as separate commits for each task) and send us a link to your branch so we can check it out!

You're welcome to make any improvements you see fit, but you won't need to update any of the root files in order to complete this challenge. Focus on those in the `src` directory.

### Setup:

1. Clone this repo locally.
2. Create a new branch that matches your GitHub username.
3. Push your branch upstream to the _origin_ remote.
4. Install packages: `npm install`
5. Start the local dev server: `npm start`

### Instructions:

- Make sure default projects get fetched from the server.
- Increase votes per project by 1 when clicked.
- Sort the list of projects alphabetically.
- Add validation so a project can only be added if the name has 5 or more characters.
